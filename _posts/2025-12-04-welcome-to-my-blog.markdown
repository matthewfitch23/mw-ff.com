Welcome to my personal blog! I'm excited to share this space with you.

This blog is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator that makes it easy to create fast, secure, and maintainable websites. Jekyll is perfect for blogging because it allows me to write posts in Markdown and focus on content rather than complicated CMS systems.

## What to Expect

I plan to share:

- Technical posts and tutorials
- Project updates and showcases
- Thoughts and ideas on various topics
- Learning experiences and insights

## About This Site

This site is hosted on mw-ff.com and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/matthewfitch23/mw-ff.com). Feel free to check it out and see how it's built!

Thanks for visiting, and I hope you find something interesting here!
